# UI metadata provider
A UI metadata provider to build a metadata driven UI. 

This approach is especially useful in project teams with a high database competence rather than UI.

In general provides an element alignment by invocation of a single endpoint which provides all data required like 
cardinality, language, font size, and font itself.
